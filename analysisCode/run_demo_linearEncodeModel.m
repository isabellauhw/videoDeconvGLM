% -- linearEncodeModel --

% CONSTRUCTOR CLASS: a function that helps to initalise an instance
% of a new object (for here, this is the the respective mouse name [mouseName],
% experimental session reference [expRef], and the motion data + experimental
% time in global time scale [motionData]. This function first
% define file and data paths, load behavioural and fluoroscent
% data for the session, define global time axis (according to the task data),
% interpolate fluoroscent data and video PCs data with the respective time
% frames in the global time axis

% INPUT:
% - *mouseName*: the name of the animal in *string* format (e.g., 'AMK035')
% - *expRef*: the experiment session reference in *string* format (e.g., '2023-06-13_1')

% format: 1) the motion PCs that was extracted from facemap, and 2)
% the callibrated event times in aligned global timeline (e.g., in sync

% OUTPUT:
% - *obj* (could be of any name your have defined in your procedural
% script): a class instance that contains 1) data table, or 2) empty regressor container
